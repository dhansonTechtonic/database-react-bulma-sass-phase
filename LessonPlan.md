# Setting Up the React, Bulma, Sass phase Lesson

## Review
- [ ] **Ask questions to determine if the previously taught content was absorbed/understood and address misconceptions if needed**

- [ ] **Ask about learners' previous experience/familiarity with the topic at hand**

What do you already know about React, Bulma, and Sass? What do you know about setting up a react environment?

- [ ] **State main goal of covering this topic**

The main goal of covering this topic is to give students practice setting up React, Bulma, and Sass.

## Overview
- [ ] **Provide a general overview of the new topic/concept**

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Bulma is a free, open source CSS framework based on Flexbox and built with Sass. Sass is a style sheet language initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum.

- [ ] **Explain what students can expect during this learning session**

Students can expect to be guided through building a front end for their database project using these technologies.

- [ ] **Create and state the content learning objectives using a "Students will be able to... (SWBAT)" statement, Bloom's action verbs, and the forms and functions of language that students will use to display their learning**

Students will be able to know how to build a React app from the ground up with Bulma and Sass for CSS.

- [ ] **Give context around how mastery of this concept ties into the overarching learning goal from the review section**

Mastery of this concept will give students a deeper understanding of how to build full stack applications and front ends in React as well as how to use Sass and a CSS framework/library.

- [ ] **Orient them as to why this learning is important and what it's benefits are for them**

Learning how to build a full stack application is important because this is what the students will be doing as developers and they will be using React, CSS Frameworks, and Sass frequently.

## Presentation

### I DO:
- [ ] **Refer to the resources below to think through your lesson I DO, WE DO, and YOU DO components**

  - [Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures](https://sirblois.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/cooperative-learning-activities.pdf)

  - [Nine Essential Learning Strategies](https://www.inflexion.org/download/37903/)

- [ ] **Describe the general concept, making links to what students have seen before**

The general concept is setting up the environment for building a front end using React, Bulma, and Sass.

- [ ] **Discuss steps involved**

Walk through setting up the environment for the database project. More details will be in the slides.

- [ ] **Discuss new terms/definitions involved**
- [ ] **Demonstrate steps involved with metacognitive dialogue (think-alouds)**

  - [Think-Aloud Protocol](https://www.teachervision.com/problem-solving/think-aloud-strategy)

  - [3 Steps for Think-Alouds](http://www.ascd.org/publications/newsletters/education-update/feb18/vol60/num02/3-Steps-for-Think-Alouds.aspx)

- [ ] **Share examples**

    [Currying](https://codepen.io/delihanson/pen/zYYxVpQ?editors=0010)

- [ ] **Instructors teach new content/language**

- [ ] **Group discussions - allow students to articulate what they saw you do**

How did I create a React app? Why did I need to npm install all these packages? Which packages did I install? What does babel do in this case? What does nodemon do?

## Exercise

### WE DO:
- [ ] **Present content that allows everyone to contribute to creating something functional (fill-in-the-blank, white-boarding a plan together, having teams or individuals write and share the logic for executing the plan, drafting a program together, something collaborative that allows them to confirm their thinking and see something work or be led through what to do if it fails)**

Help students step through the code to explain and comment what is going on in it.

- [ ] **Instructor acts as a facilitator**

Have the students ask questions about what is going on in the files in this project. Go over the .gitignore, .jshintrc, public folder, index.js, App.js, and package.json

- [ ] **Have learners explain how and why using the language objectives as many times and ways as possible**

- [ ] **Allow time for observations and questions**

- [ ] **Instructors prompt learners to apply new content/language**

Then have the students pair up and explain to each other what is happening in the code and then pick on someone to share out.

Files in project are already detailed

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### YOU DO:
- [ ] **Assign an individual practice opportunity for students to engage in learning and grapple with the content**

Have the students use the README.md to complete the database project

- [ ] **Provide extension activities for speedy learners**

If they get done early have the students help other students, add more functionality, refactor code, or fix little bugs.

- [ ] **Provide break-out sessions to facilitate small-group relearning for those who are struggling (mini-lessons on blockers)**

- [ ] **Instructors reinforce and assess learners' application of new content/language**

Do a code review with the students to make sure their code is working, they are using best practices, and there are no errors or warnings in their console.

## Summary
- [ ] **Highlight the key points of the lesson**

What was difficult about building the front end? What do you need to set up in order to build your application? How do the different files interact with each other? What is going on in your code?

- [ ] **Review the learning objectives with the class**

- [ ] **Allow students to ask and answer questions again**

- [ ] **Instructors assess learners' application of new content/language via formative assessment (exit tickets) or summative assessment (unit test)**

## Self-Assessment and Lesson Reflection

- [ ] **Take notes after you teach a lesson! When you make notes of the successes and changes you want, it is easier to remember next time**

- [ ] **Summarize, interpret, and consider the gains in academic performance levels of students in relation to where students were prior to instruction, the context in which teaching and learning occurred, and the implications of this analysis for oneâ€™s own professional effectiveness and development**

- [ ] **Reflection questions may include:**

  - How did the class do as a whole?


  - Based upon circumstances in which you were teaching, are there any conclusions you can make?
  

  - What would you do differently next time you teach this lesson?
  

  - What worked well?
  

  - How did you utilize prior student involvement and feedback?
  

  - Were all texts and additional resources appropriate?


  - How have you personally grown as a teacher from this lesson?
